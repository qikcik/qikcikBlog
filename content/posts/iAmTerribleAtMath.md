# I am terrible at math

In my two attempts to study at university, I twice failed at "mathematical analysis" in the fist year.

I have always been slow learner and the speed of learning at university didn't help me.
At that time I had some basic knowledge about graphic programming - so the most of this math abstract ideas wasn't so abstract for me,
but somehow that interact with (I don't know how to say) "my pride" so I had given up many times.

Thanks to god, some time passed and I started to fell some attraction toward math, even I think that I have grown some ambition in understanding it.

But to be honest with my self: I know that I need to start from very beginning but this time in different way.

My brain random idea machine generator generated that starting from learn how to proof thinks is a good place to start again.

I founded great video.
[Intro To Math Proofs (Full Course) - by BriTheMathGuy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3czgfHULZCs)

It in very simple way helped me to remember some basic stuff like math symbol\
Thanks to this video I think that I am finally aware that most of the proofs are not so unique and there is hidden patterns behind, or common math tricks.

This video is only the introduction and I need to do next steps,\
for now finding some book which exercises in proofing things seems to be good direction.
